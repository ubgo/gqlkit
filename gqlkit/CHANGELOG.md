# Changelog — gqlkit (CLI)

All notable changes to the `gqlkit` binary. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

Tagged as `gqlkit@vX.Y.Z`. See releases at <https://github.com/khanakia/gqlkit/releases>.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `generate` (Go): the `-m` / `--module` value was dropped, so cross-package imports in the generated SDK came out as `import ( "" )` / `import ( "/types" )` and the SDK didn't compile. `--module` is now threaded into every local package import (`types`, `enums`, `scalars`, `inputs`, `fields`, `builder`, `graphqlclient`, `batch`), each emitted as `<module>/<pkg>`. `go build ./...` on the generated SDK now succeeds. The `cmd/generate` programmatic API (which sets `Package` directly) was unaffected. ([#4](https://github.com/khanakia/gqlkit/issues/4))

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- Generated Go SDKs now ship a `batch/` package — `RunQueries` / `RunMutations` merge multiple builders into a single GraphQL operation with aliased root fields, decoded into one struct via `json` tags. One HTTP round trip for N queries.
- `OpFragment` + `BaseBuilder.GetOpFragment(alias)` on the runtime builder so each generated op can be spliced into a batched document.
- `QueryMarker` / `MutationMarker` zero-size embeds emitted by the operation template — give the type system a compile-time discriminator so mixing query + mutation builders in `RunQueries` is rejected at compile time.
- `ExecuteWithPartialData` on the generated `graphqlclient.Client` so partial-success batches still populate the destination struct alongside any GraphQL errors.

### Changed
- Generated query / mutation builders now embed a kind marker (`builder.QueryMarker` for queries, `builder.MutationMarker` for mutations) in addition to `*BaseBuilder`. Existing call sites are unaffected; the marker only matters when passing a builder to the new `batch` package.
- Generator orchestration adds a `generateBatchFiles` step (writes `<sdk>/batch/batch.go`).

### Documentation
- New "Batching multiple queries in one request" section in `docs/getting-started-go.md`.
- New `gqlkit/pkg/batch/README.md` documenting the upstream and generated faces of the package.
- WHY-comments across the new code explaining the marker pattern, partial-tolerant decoding, deterministic alias sort, and the optional `partialExecutor` interface.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-27

### Fixed
- Self-referencing object fields (e.g. `Item.parent: Item`, `KpiSnapshot.comparison: KpiSnapshot`) were generating as scalar leaves — `addField("parent")` with no selector callback — producing invalid GraphQL when used. The over-eager `baseName != def.Name` guard in `clientgents/field_sel_gen.go` and `clientgen/field_sel_gen.go` is removed; self-imports remain skipped (the only thing the guard was actually needed for). Affects both Go and TypeScript SDK generators.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-03-22

### Added
- `gqlkit-sdl` companion CLI gains a `--format json` flag for JSON SDL output (paired release).

### Changed
- Documentation clarifies the `--package` flag — passing a full import path (`example/sdk`) sets both the Go package name and the import root.
- `example-go-chat` updated to track current generator output.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- `--package` flag accepts a full Go import path. The generator splits it into a package name (last segment) and import path (all of it), so generated `import "<root>/builder"` etc. stay consistent across consumers.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- Auto-detect SDK import path from the consumer's `go.mod`. Eliminates the need to pass `--package` for the common case where the generated SDK lives inside the same module that's invoking `go run`.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- `graphqlclient` package is now generated *into* the SDK — generated SDKs are fully self-contained, no runtime dependency on the gqlkit module.
- `--config` flag is now optional. When omitted, gqlkit ships with a sensible default scalar binding set (built-in primitives only).

### Changed
- Generated imports use full GitHub module paths (`github.com/.../sdk/builder`) instead of relative paths.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- `-o` shorthand for `--output`, `-c` shorthand for `--config`.

### Changed
- `--config` flag is optional (default scalar bindings used when absent).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-18

### Added
- TypeScript codegen support — `gqlkit generate-ts` emits a typed builder SDK consuming the [`gqlkit-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gqlkit-ts) npm runtime.
- Custom scalar examples — `Cursor`, `DateTime`, `JSON`, `Metadata` — wired through mockapi and the example SDKs.
- AI-friendly documentation (`docs/ai-friendly.md`) explaining why the builder pattern works well for AI-assisted coding.
- "Comparison vs genqlient / GraphQL Code Generator" section in the README.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development setup.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-17

### Added
- Initial release. Cobra CLI with `generate` and `version` commands.
- GoReleaser-driven monorepo release workflow — tags of the form `gqlkit@vX.Y.Z` build via `.goreleaser.yml`; `install.sh` pulls the latest matching release.
- Stable download URLs (no version in artifact names).
- Generated SDK structure: `types/`, `enums/`, `inputs/`, `scalars/`, `fields/`, `queries/`, `mutations/`, `builder/`.
